### Notation for counters
* Check configuration used to specify rules on element types (BUNDLE, PACKAGE, CLASS, SOURCEFILE or METHOD) with a list of limits. Each limit applies to a certain counter (INSTRUCTION, LINE, BRANCH, COMPLEXITY, METHOD, CLASS) and defines a minimum or maximum for the corresponding value (TOTALCOUNT, COVEREDCOUNT, MISSEDCOUNT, COVEREDRATIO, MISSEDRATIO). If a limit refers to a ratio it must be in the range from 0.0 to 1.0 where the number of decimal places will also determine the precision in error messages. A limit ratio may optionally be declared as a percentage where 0.80 and 80% represent the same value.
